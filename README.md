# Overview
The goal of this program is to try to learn more about Erlang and functional languages in general. Erlang is very different from the other languages I know
so this program is very rough and actually doesn't function all the way.

This program is meant to be a pattern guessing game where the user is given a random pattern from a list with numbers missing. Their goal is to guess which numbers
are missing and input the entire list.

The purpose of writing this software was to practice coding in Erlang, including the use of displaying output to the screen, accepting input, recursion, lists, pattern matching,
and lambda functions.

# Development Environment

I coded this program in VSCode with the Erlang and Erlang LS extensions.

This program is done in Erlang.

# Future Work

* Get the program to accept the user's input and compare it to the original list.
* Add more patterns.
* Make it so that at least 4 numbers are blanked out each time.
